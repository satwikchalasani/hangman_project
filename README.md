Instructions:
1) A word is randomly generated from a word bank and placed into the word slot, but isn't available for the player to see. The player can only see how many letters the word contains.
2) A strikes blank that spells out "H-A-N-G-M-A-N" dictates how many guesses left a player has. A player, therefore, has 7 guesses total.
3) To guess a letter in the word, click on any letter in the word bank.
4) If the letter is contained in the word, the letter's position in the word is shown, and the letter in the wordbank gets crossed out with a green line.
5) If the letter is not within the word, a strike in the form of a letter spelling the word "H-A-N-G-M-A-N" is added.
6) The game is played until the player guesses all the letters in the word or all the strikes used up ("HANGMAN" is spelled).
7) The player may not guess a letter they have already guessed.
